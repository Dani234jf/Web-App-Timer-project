## About Me

##### Hi, I'm Daniel Almeida. 👋

I created this project to deepen my knowledge of CSS and JavaScript. Building this timer app taught me a lot about organising code effectively and creating systems that work well together.

It was also a great chance to explore design and frontend development practices in a practical way. I enjoy developing projects that challenge me and help me grow as a developer.
